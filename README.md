# Vehicle-Price-Prediction-craigslist-dataset

This project builds a regression model to predict used vehicle prices based on a wide range of features like manufacturer, model, fuel type, year, mileage, and more. The goal is to demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using **LightGBM** in a real-world context.


## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess a large real-world dataset
- Handle missing values intelligently using various strategies
- Encode categorical variables using `OneHotEncoder`
- Build and evaluate a regression model with LightGBM
- Interpret performance with RMSE and RÂ² score


## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— **[Used Cars Dataset - Craigslist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data)**


## ðŸ§  Tools & Libraries

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ data handling  
  - `scikit-learn` â€“ preprocessing and evaluation  
  - `lightgbm` â€“ model training  


## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

- **RÂ² Score**: `0.8008`  
- **Test RMSE**: `6434.15`

âœ… This means the model can explain around **80%** of the variance in vehicle pricesâ€”strong for such a diverse dataset.
